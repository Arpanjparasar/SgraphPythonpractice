Polymorphism: IT is a concept in OOPs which helps in calling different member functions from common object

Inheritance: It is a concept by which we can use the member function and member variable of the inherited class.

Abstraction: It is aconcept which binds the class to the Interpreter and not the object. This makes the class only Inheritable.
